------------------------Model and Modelling Notes----------------------------------------
- The model is saved and has already been initialized and run with the MOST PROBABLE
	conditions from the 24-MS.
- Model outputs for the MRM run have also been generated and included in this package
- Depending on your familiarity with RiverWare, you can either run the model by opening 
	and running it within the interface, or you can run the model via the Batch program 
	included in this package. 
- It is imperative that you execute the "1.SetMtomDirectory.bat" program to set the 
	MTOM_DIR Environment Variable on your local machine. The Environment Variable is 
	referenced within the model to find the required input and output files and 
	directories.
- Open the MTOM RiverWare model located in the "RW Files" directory. In RiverWare, navigate
	to Multiple Run Management and choose the "Run_CBRFC_Ensemble_Fcst_RFC" Multiple Run 
	Configuration. Click "Start" after first making sure the Excel workbooks with 
	ensemble forecasts and outputs are closed. This will run the Most Probable and ESP 
	forecasts. 
- Model outputs are automatically placed by the model in the "Output Data" directory
	and runs initiated from the RiverWare interface will output results to the existing
	files. Open the Excel workbook "MTOM_EnsembleOutput.xlsm", navigate to the "Comparison"
	tab, and check that the Start Timestep is correct. Then click the "Load All Data" button 
	to load new output traces to the workbook. 
- Model inputs are queried by the model from the "Inflow Forecasts" and "Input Data"
	directories. The model relies on specific naming conventions so please do not rename 
	files in these directories.
